= dhcp-api

Provides YANG model that defines DHCP configuration for VPP.

Currently only DHCP relay configuration is supported.

Operational data model is not supported
(there is no binary API for reading DHCP configuration).

== Notes on model
* DHCP relay configuration is based on dhcp_proxy_config_2 message API:

* More info regarding functionality provided by VPP can be found
