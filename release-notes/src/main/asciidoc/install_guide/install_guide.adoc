=== Distribution notes
Honeycomb is packaged as a static set of jars, that are loaded by Honeycomb Main class, where pre-configured plugins are then started.

=== Footprint

Minimal footprint for Honeycomb infrastructure (without any plugins) at rest below 100Mb. For Honeycomb distribution with VPP related plugins, minimal footprint was observed below 150Mb.
The footprint varies depending on:

* VM load. Under heavier load, JVM tends to release some unused memory used during Honeycomb initialization.
* Northbound interface configuration (4 interfaces started by default: Restconf HTTP, HTTPS, Netconf TCP, SSH). Minimal footprint can be achieved by using only a single interface.
* JVM configuration. Even lower footprint numbers can be achieved by using aggressive JVM memory options: -client -Xms20m -Xmx32m -XX:MetaspaceSize=5m -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=32m -XX:MaxMetaspaceExpansion=1m -Xss512k -XX:+UseSerialGC -Djava.compiler=NONE -Xverify:none -noverify
* Amount of data stored by Honeycomb.
