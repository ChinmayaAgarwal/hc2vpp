== IETF models

Hc2vpp implementation of MPLS uses following ietf models:
- ietf-mpls
- ietf-mpls-static
- ietf-routing-types

Models were modified due to YANGTOOLS/MDSAL issues
and some problems with the models itself.
More information can be found in yang files.

Original YANG files were downloaded from

https://github.com/ietf-mpls-yang/te/

== VPP specific options

VPP allows to perform lookup in ipv4 or ipv6 or mpls table.
Lookup table for pop-and-lookup operation can be specified
using static-lsp-vpp-lookup-augmentation
provided by vpp-mpls yang module.
