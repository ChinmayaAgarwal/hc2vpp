= nat-api

The APIs are based on ietf-nat YANG model draft:
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-sivakumar-yang-nat-05

== Notes on model
* Nat-instances map to VRF in VPP (nat-instance/id mapps to VRF-ID)

== Deviations
* nat-state/nat-instances/nat-instance/id type changed to uint32 from int32
* "mandatory true" statements commented to support partial model implementation
